## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Frontend framework


### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://react.dev/) - Utilizing the React documentation helped strengthen my understanding of useState and useEffect, which I incorporated in the slider function of my card component.
- [Stackoverflow - Bootstrap Toggle Switch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65245405/how-to-change-color-of-knob-in-bootstrap-5-switch) - This post on stackoverflow was so helpful when it came to customizing the toggle switch in Bootstrap. I couldn't find what I was looking for in the documentation but this post pointed out which classes to target to customize the outline, knob, and fill color of the switch.
